# BreathM

BreathM is a cross-platform multiplayer framework and launcher for **The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild** on **Cemu**.

Inspired by FiveM and RedM, the long-term goal is to create a true multiplayer platform for BOTW rather than a simple launcher.

> Early alpha software. Expect bugs and breaking changes.
